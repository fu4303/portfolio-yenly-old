      <p>
        Transitioning into the next chapter in my career by joining a nonprofit in hopes of doing meaningful work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking a pause in my #100DaysOfCode Project to plan out how to balance my focus on:
        <ul>
          <li>My learning (inside and outside my career).</li>
          <li>Self-care strategies.</li>
          <li>Personal connections with others.</li>
          <li>Creative play and refinement in my art.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
